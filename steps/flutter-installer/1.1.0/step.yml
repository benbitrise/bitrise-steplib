title: Flutter Install
summary: Install Flutter SDK.
description: |-
  This Step installs the Flutter SDK using FVM, ASDF, or manual installation methods and runs the initial setup.
  Use this step *before* the cache-pull step to make sure caching works correctly.

  ### Configuring the Step
  1. In the **Flutter SDK version or bundle URL** input set the version, tag, branch, or bundle URL. The default value is `stable`.
  2. Enable **Print debug information** to run `flutter doctor` to see if there are any missing platform dependencies for setting up Flutter.

  ### Troubleshooting
  If you prefer to install Flutter from an installation bundle instead of the git repository, provide a Flutter SDK bundle URL in the **Flutter SDK version or bundle URL** input. For example, `https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra/releases/dev/windows/flutter_windows_v1.14.5-dev.zip`. When a valid bundle URL is provided, it will download and install from that bundle instead of cloning from git.
